Place these modules within your app under the following directory:

    appserver/modules/admin/widgets

For example, this would be under the following assuming your app is named "${value.build.prefix}":

    $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/${value.build.prefix}/appserver/modules/admin/widgets

Below is some information about the modules created:

    Build: ${value.build.number}
    Last commit: ${value.build.date}
